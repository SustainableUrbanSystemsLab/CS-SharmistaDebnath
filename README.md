# CP-Evaluating-Ventilation-Strategies-Impacts-on-Occupant-Safety-and-Thermal-Comfort-in-Isolated-ICU
This research investigates how common ventilation strategies: laminar flow vs. mixing ventilation, different ACH levels, and negative pressurization ranges affect:  Contaminant transport, Airflow patterns, Thermal comfort. The study uses CFD modeling (ANSYS Fluent) to replicate realistic ICU geometry and heat loads under isolated-room conditions.

# Abstract
Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) and infection control in healthcare facilities have become a critical priority since the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors plays an important role in patients’ recovery, wellbeing and comfort. This study aims to evaluate airflow patterns and particle dispersion under different ventilations strategies in negatively pressurized isolated ICUs as a case study. The objective is to assess their effect on contamination control and thermal comfort of the patient. For the methodology steady-state Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used with Lagrangian particle tracking and Reynold Stress (k- ε) turbulence modelling to accurately represent the turbulence and buoyancy in the airflow using ANSYS FLUENT software. Results demonstrate that laminar air flow systems provide better directional control and efficient contaminant control in the breathing zone, while mixing ventilation achieves uniform thermal stratification under enhanced pressure isolation, making it suitable for high-risk infectious disease scenario. The findings indicate that under both ventilation strategies, a high air change rate (12-20 ACH) and negative pressurization help in effective infection control by reducing the particle clearance times while maintaining patients’ thermal comfort in isolated ICU settings.

## Instructions for reconstructing mesh geometry in Jupyter Notebook 
Despite these standards and prior studies, healthcare facilities still face a fundamental design challenge: they must maximize infection control, maintain thermal comfort, and control energy use at the same time. There is no quantitative, ICU‑specific evidence comparing the most commonly used ventilation strategies namely laminar airflow versus mixing ventilation under the same conditions. 

Especially with respect to particle clearance times that:
- how high to push Air change rates, 
- how much negative pressure is beneficial beyond the minimum standard, and 
- how supply temperature and localized drafts affect patients safety and comfort. 

Why it matters? These gaps matter a lot because single wrong choice in ventilation strategy can lead to expensive retrofits, wasted energy, or increased infection risk increasing patients recovery time.
