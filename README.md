# CP-Evaluating-Ventilation-Strategies-Impacts-on-Occupant-Safety-and-Thermal-Comfort-in-Isolated-ICU
This research investigates how common ventilation strategies: laminar flow vs. mixing ventilation, different ACH levels, and negative pressurization ranges affect:  Contaminant transport, Airflow patterns, Thermal comfort. The study uses CFD modeling (ANSYS Fluent) to replicate realistic ICU geometry and heat loads under isolated-room conditions.

# Abstract
Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) and infection control in healthcare facilities have become a critical priority since the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors plays an important role in patients’ recovery, wellbeing and comfort. This study aims to evaluate airflow patterns and particle dispersion under different ventilations strategies in negatively pressurized isolated ICUs as a case study. The objective is to assess their effect on contamination control and thermal comfort of the patient. For the methodology steady-state Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used with Lagrangian particle tracking and Reynold Stress (k- ε) turbulence modelling to accurately represent the turbulence and buoyancy in the airflow using ANSYS FLUENT software. Results demonstrate that laminar air flow systems provide better directional control and efficient contaminant control in the breathing zone, while mixing ventilation achieves uniform thermal stratification under enhanced pressure isolation, making it suitable for high-risk infectious disease scenario. The findings indicate that under both ventilation strategies, a high air change rate (12-20 ACH) and negative pressurization help in effective infection control by reducing the particle clearance times while maintaining patients’ thermal comfort in isolated ICU settings.
